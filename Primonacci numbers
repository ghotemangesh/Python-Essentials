Problem Statement:
Write a program to print the sum of Primonacci numbers between two given numbers i and j (both inclusive).

Primonacci number: it is a prime number present in the Fibonacci series
Fibonacci series: it is a sequence of numbers generated by f(n) which is defined by: f(0)=0, f(1)=1 and f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) for n>1.
Constraints:
0<=i<j<=600000
Input format:
i and j is given in a single line separated by space. Read the input from the standard input stream.
Output format:
Print the sum of Primonacci numbers to the standard output stream.
Sample Input	Sample Output	Explanation
1 100	113	There are six primonacci numbers between 1 and 100, those are 1 2 3 5 13 89 and their sum is 113
90 100	0	There are no primonacci numbers between 90 and 100 so the sum will be 0.

def primecheck(a):
  for i in range(2,a//2+1):
    if(a%i==0):
      return False
  return True
#for input use:
start = list(map(int,raw_input().split()))
#start=[1,110]
list1=[]
list1.append(1)
prev=1
list1.append(prev)
limit=600000
n=1
while(n<limit):
  n=list1[-1]+list1[-2]
  list1.append(n)
outputlist=[]
for i in range(start[0],start[1]+1):
  if(i in list1):
    res=primecheck(i)
    if(res==True):
      outputlist.append(i)
#print(outputlist)
if(len(outputlist)==0):
  print(0)
else:
  print(sum(outputlist))
