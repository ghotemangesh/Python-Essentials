Answer:(100%)
a=list(raw_input().split(","))
list2=[]
for i in range(0,len(a)):
  str1=""
  a1=a[i].split(":")
  str1+=a1[0][:2]
  str1+=a1[1][-2::1]
  sum1=0
  for s1 in range(0,len(a1[2]),2):
      sum1+=int(a1[2][s1]) 
  str1+=str(sum1)
  str1+=str(i+1)
  list2.append(str1)
s1=""
for k in range(0,len(list2)):
  s1+=(''.join(list2[k])+",")
print(s1[:-1])
