Write a program to print a list of one-step numbers present in the given range [S,E] (including S and E). A number is said to be a one-step number if the absolute difference between its consecutive digits is 1. Print -1 if no such numbers are present in the given range.
Input format:
The first line gives the first number S in the range.
The second line gives the last number E in the range.
Read the input from the standard input.
Constraints:
9<S<E<100000
Output format:
Print the one-step numbers in ascending order, each number separated by a comma.
Print -1 if no such numbers are present. Print the output to the standard output.
Sample Input	Sample Output	Explanation
101
200	101,121,123	The first number in the range i.e 101 is a one-step number as the absolute difference between consecutive digits i.e. 1 - 0, 0 - 1 is 1.However, the next number 102 is not a one-step number because 1 - 0 is although 1 but 0 - 2 is 2. On a similar basis numbers 121 and 123 are one-step numbers and the rest are not in the given range.
10
20	10,12	
124
200	-1

#for input use:
a = int(raw_input())
b = int(raw_input())
list1=[]
for i in range(a,b):
  s1=str(i)
  cnt=1
  for j in range(0,len(s1)-1):
    if(  abs(int(s1[j])- int(s1[j+1]))==1  ):
      cnt+=1
  if(cnt==len(s1)):
    list1.append(s1)
if(len(list1)==0):
  print (-1)
else:
  str1=""
  for i in range(0,len(list1)):
    str1+=list1[i]
    str1+=","
  print(str1[:-1])
