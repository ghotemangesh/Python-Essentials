Problem Statement:
Given an arithmetic expression with parentheses, write a program to print the sequence of opening and closing of parentheses.
For example, consider the following expression:
(a + b)*(5*(c - d))
Paranthesis 1 opens
Paranthesis 1 closes
Paranthesis 2 opens
Paranthesis 3 opens
Paranthesis 3 closes
Paranthesis 2 closes
Hence, the sequence will be: 112332
Input Format
A single line contains an arithmetic expression having at least one parenthesis. Read the input from standard input.
Output Format
Print the sequence of the opening and closing of parentheses to standard output.
Sample Input	Sample Output	Explanation
(5+(t * (10 - 6))) + (8 + f)	12332144	In the sample input first parentheses starts at the first index before 5, so print 1.
 Second parentheses start before t, so print 2. Third parentheses start before 10,
 so print 3. Third parentheses end after 6, so print 3. Second parentheses end 
after the end of third parentheses, so print 2, and so on.
